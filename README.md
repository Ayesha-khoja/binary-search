Binary Search Program in C++
This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates the binary search algorithm. 
The program includes a function binaryserach() that takes an array, the size of the array, and the key to be searched for as parameters.
The function returns the index of the key if it is found in the array, otherwise, it returns -1.

Usage
To use this program, simply compile the code and run it.
The program includes two arrays, one with even numbers and one with odd numbers. 
It demonstrates how to use the binarysearch() function to search for the index of a key in each array. 
The program will output the index of the key in the array, or -1 if the key is not found.

Conclusion
This program is a simple implementation of the binary search algorithm in C++.
It can be used as a starting point for more complex search algorithms or as a learning tool for beginners.
